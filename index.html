    <p>
      The discipline and consistent hardwork is what will keep me going. I must be able to wake up early each morning and put myself to the test each and everyday. A times i do become lazy forgetting what i am supposed to work on. Prayers and consistent hardwork is what is gonna help me. Nothing more to expect if i don't work hard. If I continue to be lazy i will fuck up real bad.

      I found that nothing in life is worth while unless you take risks, nothing, Nelson Mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small in settling for a life that's less
      than the one you're capable of living. If i'm going to fall I don't want to fall back on anything, I want to fall forward, I figure at least this way i'll see what, i'm going to hit.

      The struggle of life is one of our greatest blessings. It makes us patient, sensitive, and Godlike. It teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
    <p>
       As i know that if I hang around the barber shop long enough, sooner or later, I'm are going to get a hair cut. And i must keep pushing and hold my ground as a spartan. I must build myself to earn value as a man. I am ready for it.

      My parents back at home are struggling, my brothers and sisters are struggling, the success of my family relies on me. If i don't make it we'll be fuck up as shit. If i don't make it they woul'd know i even tried, so i must make it.
